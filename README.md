The purpose of this project is to apply data science to real life problems.  I want to maximize the amount of groceries I can get, minimize the amount of money I spend on groceries, minimize the amount of time I spend figuring out what to buy/cook, and minimize the amount of food I waste.

Parts of the project
1. Android App
* Contains an activity that has a standard shopping list
* Contains an activity that allows uploading images of groceries/reciepts
* working on cv algorithm to detect grocery images (need to collect lots of data)
* working on ocr to convert reciept data into text
* working on an activty that routes users throughtout the store
2. REST API
* Node.js REST API to connect Android App + future website/IoT scanner to Postgresql Database
* Recommender system to suggest items to add to shopping list -- Playing around with reinforcement learning (https://www.kaggle.com/osbornep/reinforcement-learning-for-meal-planning-in-python/notebook)
3. Website
* TODO - dashboard to show what's being bought/used (could add front end to restapi)
4. IoT Scanner
* TODO - something to figure out what groceries are being used / what's left in the cupboard/fridge.  Possibly raspberry pi w/ camera or android app
